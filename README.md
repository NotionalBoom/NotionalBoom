- Hello World, I’m @NotionalBoom.
- For the last several years I worked at a startup that manufactured drone detection sensors. Fortunately, I worked along side my father. He was an incredibly accomplished hardware engineer with several hardware and software patents.
- I mostly did frontend work, we built our platform in Ionic (which is great btw). I also handled all the sales and marketing, design work, bills, etc. Everything except the hardware and server code.
- But then my father passed away unexpectedly in mid-July, 2022. I miss him dearly. Most mornings I still expect to see an email from him in my inbox.
- As someone who did RF detection for living, he was very privacy focused, and joked that he was one of the 9 Americans that never owned a cell phone.
- That privacy focus unfortunately included his extensive use of file and folder encryption.
- All of our board designs, server credential keyes, and more are locked away, forever, on his desktop.
- So, while our company and technology died alongside him, I'm focusing on the opportunity to do my father proud.
- He was an engineer's engineer, and I've decided I'm going to follow in his footsteps.
- For the next several months, I'm going to study, train, and practice with the goal of getting a job as a full-stack engineer. 
- I'm lucky that I have a strong background in frontend work, but I still have a lot to learn.
